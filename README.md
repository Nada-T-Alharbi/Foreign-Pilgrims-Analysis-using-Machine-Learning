# **Foreign Pilgrims Analysis using Machine Learning**
### A Project for Predicting the Number of Foreign Pilgrims

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes and predicts the number of foreign pilgrims based on historical data, including factors such as **year, month, and age category**. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and used to train machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Classifies whether the number of foreign pilgrims is above or below the median value.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains information on foreign pilgrims categorized by:
- **Year (`السنة`)**
- **Month (`الشهر`)**
- **Age Category (`الفئة العمرية`)**
- **Number of Foreign Pilgrims (`عدد معتمري الخارج`)**

### **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Converted numerical data stored as strings into integer format.
- Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Created a **binary classification** column for logistic regression.

## **Data Source**
The dataset used in this project was obtained from:

🔗 **[Website Name](https://www.haj.gov.sa/OpenData)**


## **Installation & Setup**
To run this project, you need Python and some libraries installed.

#**Result**
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 98.59%, suggesting high predictive capability.
